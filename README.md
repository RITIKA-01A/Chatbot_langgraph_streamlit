# LangGraph Chatbot with Persistence

This project is a **chatbot built using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)**.  
It implements **persistence** via **checkpointers** and **thread IDs**, ensuring that session state is maintained across conversations.

## ✨ Features
- Built with **LangGraph** for modular conversational flows.  
- **Checkpointer support** – saves state after each node execution.  
- **Thread-based session management** – allows resuming conversations seamlessly.  
- Maintains **conversation context** across multiple turns.
